# template-newsilk-tablo2

## Joomla 4.4.14 installation

If you install as a **package**, archive the repository root so the zip contains:

- `pkg_newsilk_brics.xml`
- `tpl_brics_freight/` (with `templateDetails.xml` inside)

The template manifest references `media/images` and `media/fonts`, so these folders must exist in the package.
This repository includes placeholders:

- `tpl_brics_freight/media/images/index.html`
- `tpl_brics_freight/media/fonts/index.html`

If you prefer a direct template install, zip the `tpl_brics_freight/` folder itself and install that archive.
